/* Overview
 
 Your assignment is to create your own programming problem using variables, operators, and assignment. Think about the Operators playground you completed. This assignment is like you are producing a page for that assignment. You will work on your playground page in a playground cloned from GitHub. It should include *at least* the following:
 
 - three arithmetic operators
 - one compound operator
 - three variables
 - one type conversion
 
 It's not very exciting to have a bunch of random numbers in code. When writing this problem you should be creating a story around it. This need not be tremendously complex, just a simple story that motivates the values being used and gives them a context.
 
 For example 40 / 5 isn't interesting, but writing a tree planting app that given a species of tree and how much space you have will estimate how many trees you can plant is moreso. (e.g., I have 40 sq ft and want to plant walnut trees. They need 5 sq ft of growing space around the trunk, how many can I fit?).
 
 You should write your story bits in comments (e.g., between /* and */, or lines starting with // ) around where the code should go.

/* Elizabeth wants to cover her one exposed wall entirely with posters. Create constants wallWidth and wallHeight, representing the width and height of the wall in feet. Then create constant wallArea, which uses wallWidth and wallHeight to determine the area of the wall. */
let wallWidth = 6
let wallHeight = 8
let wallArea = wallWidth * wallHeight
print(wallArea)

/* Elizabeth has a dozen "chirashi" posters - small, Japanese, movie promotional posters - she'd like to have going along the top of the wall. Create constants chirashiWidth and chirashiHeight, representing the width and height of these posters. */
let chirashiWidth = 0.75
let chirashiHeight = 0.9
